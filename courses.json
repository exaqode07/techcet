    "coursePara1": "This professional course covers Manual Software Testing, API Testing using the POSTMAN tool, and Database Management Systems. Manual testing is a crucial aspect of software quality assurance where a Test Engineer conducts quality checks without the use of automation tools. Its purpose is to ensure that the software performs as intended and meets both technical and business requirements. Manual quality assurance can detect design and usability defects that cannot be detected by Automation Testing. Even the most sophisticated automated test scripts cannot match what a human tester can see from a customer's perspective and comprehend on an emotional level.",
    "coursePara2": "The heart and soul of any software application is the data stored in databases for retrieval and further processing. The database system selected for an application should meet the application's data processing and storage requirements. In this course, we will explore the MySQL Database Management System alongside Manual Software Testing.",
